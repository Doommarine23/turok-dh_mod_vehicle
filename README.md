# WHAT
This depot contains the script logic and art assets for functioning vehicles in Nightdive Studio's Turok Remaster.

# HOW TO USE
To playtest - Download the KPF and put into your mods folder. Open the console with ~ and type "level maps/dm23_vehicle_test.map"
to develop - Fork / download the assets and do as necessary for your mod. The scripts are all the game logic, the assets are art to make it look good. The level is simply for testing.

# DOCUMENTATION
Not at this time. Code has comments and descriptive names, but true documentation will not be completed until the core systems are done.

# LICENSE
I have complied with GPL V3.0 as this is the license followed by all the moddable scripts in the Turok remaster.

In truth, I don't care what you do, as long as it is legal. My work is a mixture of my own creative effort and modifying the scripts and art assets of the Turok remaster for non-commerical modification purposes.

All I ask is that you respect the license, make cool mods, credit me, and link me to your work if possible so I can check it out.
